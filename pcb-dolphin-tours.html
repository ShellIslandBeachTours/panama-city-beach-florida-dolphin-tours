"text": "Many man-made and natural reefs are found in Destin. Most of the reefs are close to public beaches. This makes it easier for guests. Nearby restrooms and public parking are provided for the majority of reefs. The majority of these reefs can usually be found 200 to 300 meters away from the beach."

<div><p>Captain John, as well as Layla, was a great sidekick. We saw dolphins, got in the water with them, and saw turtles as well as rays and crabs. He also took us on a private trip to find shells, and returned with our full bucket. We were able to personalize it to what we wanted, as we had a 13-year-old and a 10 year-old. Everyone !!!" <b>Adventure</b>  had an amazing time.</p><p>West End Panama City Beach’s West End hosts quieter communities that line the beaches, as well as smaller condos.</p><p>We went twice to shell island beach. We paid PS7.50 for parking on the island. A second time, we drove further down the coast towards Llanddwywe to find a public park. The beach is huge and beautiful.</p></div>

The floodwaters were released just as the digging began and rushed through to create what we now refer to as the East Pass.</p><p>Dolphins are wild and will bite people who are upset, frustrated, or afraid. They can be disturbed by people trying to swim with them. <i>Seaside</i>  Dolphins who have become career-begging smugglers can be aggressive and pushy.</p></div>

The first time we paid PS7.50 to park on the "island", the second time we drove a bit further along the coast to Llanddwywe and found a public parking lot. It is a beautiful, clean beach.</p><p>The Gulf of Mexico's clear waters will allow you to feel the ocean spray as your body zips across them in search of dolphins. Shell Island Beach Tours partnered with Adventures at Sea to offer a Jet Ski experience. You'll be accompanied by a guide and will learn all about the most interesting spots. Even if this is your first time riding a Jet Ski, it's easy to pick up the basics from an experienced guide. Adventures at Sea also offers a dolphinboat cruise to Shell Island.</p><br><br><h2>PCB Dolphin Tours - Rating</h2><ul><li>Lighthouse</li><li>Soothing</li><li>Development</li><li>Memory</li><li>Recommendation</li><li>Forecast</li><li>Wonder</li><li>Sunshine</li><li>Horizon</li><li>Captain</li><li>Seagulls</li></ul> </div>
