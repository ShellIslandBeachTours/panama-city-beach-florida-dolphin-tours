<div> <p>Provisioned Dolphins are basically bribed with fish to interact and socialize with humans. They only show interest in humans because they get free food, unlike the lonely and social dolphins. Visitors report regular interactions with them that are curious and friendly. Aggression however, is still a problem.</p><p>Panama City Beach - Gulf World Marine Park</p><p>"We had an incredible time!" <b>Relaxing</b>  Captain Alex, Co-Captain Layla, it was so much fun!<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin discovery excursions - Wind</h2><ol><li>Memories</li><li>Nature</li><li>Lighthouse</li><li>Soothing</li><li>Development</li><li>Memory</li><li>Recommendation</li><li>Forecast</li><li>Wonder</li><li>Sunshine</li><li>Horizon</li><li>Captain</li></ol> We were able see sea turtles, dolphins, find sand dollars and snorkel, among many other things!</p></div>

<div><p>July July is Panama City's most wet month, with an average 18.0 days of at least 0.04 in precipitation. The drier season runs 8.9 months, and is from September 11th to June 9.</p><p>About twenty minutes. The ride to the island takes about twenty minutes. There are great opportunities to spot manatees, turtles, and dolphins along the way. On the ferry boat, we often see seabirds on our journey to Shell Key.</p><p>The dolphins of St. Andrew Bay are wild animals, so it is impossible to predict the best time to see them. <b>Nature</b>  <b>Wind</b>  Dolphin behavior is influenced by the season, weather conditions, water temperatures, tide cycles, and availability of prey among many other factors.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin discovery excursions - Excursion</h2><ol><li>Excursion</li><li>Rating</li><li>Seafood</li><li>Memories</li><li>Nature</li><li>Lighthouse</li><li>Soothing</li><li>Development</li><li>Memory</li><li>Recommendation</li><li>Forecast</li><li>Wonder</li><li>Sunshine</li></ol> Generally, there is a good chance of seeing dolphins any time the sun is out and the water is calm and clear. Feeding activities are normally seen on an outgoing tide. Your best bet is to choose a dolphin tour operator like Panama Beach Dolphin Tours that is on the water nearly every day of the year.</p></div>
