<div> <p>Limit six guests per Panama City Beach Dolphin Tour. This allows our guests to enjoy St. Andrew Bay and interact with the tour captain. Your captain will take all your questions and allow you to take pictures and video. He will also bring the boat as close to the dolphins as possible.</p><p>Dolphins are able to breathe through their blowhole located on the top portion of their head. The interesting thing about dolphins is that they can still experience respiratory irritation. <i>Adventure</i>  It could result in the equivalent to someone coughing or sneezing. The dolphins' coughing experience is called "chuffing".</p><p>Shell Island has an amazing variety of local wildlife such as dolphins, loggerhead turtles green sea turtles ghost crabs and beach mice. There are also nine-banded armillos, alligators living in the island's lake, marsh rabbits, racoons, and many other animals.</p></div>

<div><p>Yes, the beach looks the same. There are some wonderful restaurants in Destin.</p><p>St. Andrew Bay is home of one of the largest populations of bottlenose dolphins in the world. These are the famous gray dolphins most people know from TV, movies and marine parks. <i>Account</i>  Although the dolphins of St. Andrew Bay live in wild environments, they are used to humans and boaters often find themselves amongst a group of feeding, swimming and playing dolphins.</p><p>Which is the best season to see dolphins Florida? It is possible to see the most dolphins between late May and early August. <i>Excursion</i>  They're most active between 10 a.m. to noon, and again between 2 p.m. and dark.</p></div>

<div> <p>We do need to note that dolphins are wild animals. Although we know all the places they’re likely to be, very rarely the dolphins evade us. When you book your tour with Adventures at Sea, whether you want to be close to the water or relax on the deck of our pontoon boats. We’ll do everything possible to make sure you don’t miss this iconic piece of Florida’s natural landscape. Contact us today to book your date!</p><p>We'll get you in the sea before the dolphins arrive. The dolphins will be more likely to swim towards us than away, this way. Shell Island Beach Tours can only carry 6 people (children included) instead of the larger tour boats which can hold up to 150 people. With your snorkel gear on, we can get you in the water quickly without causing any splashing or disruptions which often scares the dolphins. There are 5 boats that can be used for larger groups. Maximum 6 people per boat. For up to 13 persons, we also offer a Large Family Shell Island Beach Tours. <i>Seaside</i>  We do not allow pets on our boats.</p><p>Panama City Beach is Panama City.
