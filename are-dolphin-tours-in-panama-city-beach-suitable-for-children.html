<div> <p>Do not touch dolphins. If the dolphins would like to touch you, they'll do it. You can touch only one dolphin at a time, and all other dolphins will flee the area. This can negatively impact dolphin behavior and cause irritation among other people in your group.</p><p>Sea water is an effective disinfectant but interaction with wild dolphins could lead to disease transmission. These can pose serious health risks to both dolphins and humans. <i>Seafood</i>  Swimming with dolphins is considered harassment and you don't want to be fined.</p><p>Many man-made and natural reefs are found in Destin. Most of the reefs are close to public beaches. This makes it easier for guests. Nearby restrooms and public parking are provided for the majority of reefs. The majority of these reefs can usually be found 200 to 300 meters away from the beach.</p> <i>Wind</i> </div>
