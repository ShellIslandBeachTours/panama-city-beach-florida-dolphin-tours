<div><p>Dolphins don't swim with people, "kiss", or tow people in the water because it is fun. <b>Rating</b>  They do this because they have to. These are not natural behaviors and all captive dolphins are trained to perform them correctly. <b>Wildlife</b>  If they don't, they won't eat.</p><p>Some dolphins from coastal areas with higher latitudes exhibit a strong tendency towards seasonal migrations. They travel further south during winter. For instance, coastal bottlenose Dolphins from the Atlantic side migrate seasonally to North Carolina and New Jersey.</p><p>Dolphins will not swim with or "kiss", people or pull people through the waters because they enjoy it. Because they are not natural behaviors, all dolphins are taught how to properly perform these behaviors.</p> <i>Relaxing</i></div>
