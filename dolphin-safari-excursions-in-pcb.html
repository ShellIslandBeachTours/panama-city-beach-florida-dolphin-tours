<div> <p>Dolphins can be seen in most areas of the world when the sun shines and the water is clear. Feeding activities can usually be seen at an outgoing tide. You are best to find a dolphin tour operator such as Panama Beach Dolphin Tours, which is available almost every day of the year.</p><p>You can touch the dolphin's bellies and hold on to their pectoral fins while they swim around the lagoon.<br><br><h2>Dolphin Safari Excursions in PCB - Rating</h2><ul><li>Seaside</li><li>Report</li><li>Wildlife</li><li>Praise</li><li>Sunrise</li><li>Excursion</li><li>Rating</li><li>Seafood</li><li>Memories</li><li>Nature</li><li>Lighthouse</li><li>Soothing</li></ul> This is called "Belly Ride". The "Boogie Push", the last activity, is similar to the "Foot Push", except that you are pushed and ride a boogieboard.</p><p>This means that although dolphins don't have a schedule, they are usually most active during the day when there is sunlight for hunting and social activities.</p> </div>
