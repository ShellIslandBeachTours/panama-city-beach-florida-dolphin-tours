There are five boats with identical designs for larger groups. <i>Wind</i>  The new Large Family Shell Island Beach Tours can accommodate up to 13 guests.

<div> <p>The Gulf of Mexico is home to marine mammals such as dolphins, whales, and one species of sirenian, the West Indian Manatee (Trichechusmanatus). No sea lions (fur seals), seals, or seagoing otters are found in the Gulf of Mexico as they are elsewhere.</p><p>We will put you in water before the dolphins come. By doing this, dolphins are more likely than not to swim away to us to find us. Shell Island Beach Tours only has six passengers (including children) and is not like larger boats with up to 150 passengers. We can quickly get you on the water wearing your snorkel gear without the disruptions and splashing that large groups cause. This is often what scares the dolphins away. <i>Seaside</i>  We have 5 identical boats to accommodate larger groups. There is also a Large Family Shell Island Beach Tours that can hold up to thirteen passengers. Please no pets allowed on boats.</p><p>Dolphin Swim Adventure Rates: $170 Adult/ $140 Child per Person plus Tax.</p> </div>

<div><p>The wildest dolphins will bite when they're angry, frustrated or afraid. <b>Nature</b>  They will bite if they see people swimming with them. Dolphins who have become career hustlers can be aggressive, pushy and threatening if the handouts they aren't getting are not forthcoming.</p><p>Panama City Beach, Bay County and other beaches offer excellent snorkeling and swimming spots that are not found in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>The "Belly Ride" allows you to touch dolphins' bellies while holding onto their pectoral fins. <b>Sunrise</b>  The "Boogie Push", which is the last activity of the day, is the same as "Foot Push", but you'll be pushed while riding a boogieboard.</p> <b>Relaxing</b></div>
