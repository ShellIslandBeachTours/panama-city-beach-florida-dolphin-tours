<div><p>In Florida, the best time to catch Mahi Mahi is in the spring and summer. This migratory fish can be found less than 10 miles off shore in the Atlantic Ocean from April through October. Mahi mahi's length can reach up to 63 inches and their average weight is around 30 pounds.</p><p>Dolphins are wild animals, however. Even though we are familiar with all of the locations they might be in, it is rare for dolphins to escape our reach. Adventures at Sea will take you to the water, or you can relax on the decks our pontoon boat boats. We will make every effort to make sure that you don't miss this famous piece of Florida's natural scenery. Get in touch with us to reserve your date today!</p><p>Shell Island Beach Tours offers a fun way for your whole group to get on the water. These items are available to purchase both onsite and online in order to maximize your enjoyment.</p> <i>Wind</i></div>
