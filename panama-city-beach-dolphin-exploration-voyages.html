<div> <p>Dolphins have a reputation of being friendly. However, they are wild animals and should be treated with respect. <b>Account</b>  People can make dolphin behavior worse by interacting with them. They become less wary and are more vulnerable to shark attack or vandalism.</p><p>The danger to sea lions is usually low. Sea lions are not aggressive and tend to keep to themselves. However, being wild animals that weigh 600 pounds they need to be respected. There have been occasions when sea-lions have inflicted serious injuries on humans.</p><p>The Marine Mammal Protection Act may consider swimming with spinner dolphins as "harassment". Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, any act that can disrupt a marine mammal’s behavior, such as tormenting, seeking torment or harassing them, is considered "harassment".</p></div>
