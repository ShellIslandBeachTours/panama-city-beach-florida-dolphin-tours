<div> <p>You can attract dolphins simply by being a floating thing and sweetening water with chunks Spanish sardines, ballyhoo or pilchards. It's an economical way to score, as you can sit down, chat with friends, and listen to some tunes.</p><p>Dolphins don't swim with people, "kiss", or tow people in the water because it is fun.
