<div><p>When is the best season to see dolphins of Florida? <b>Seafood</b>  It is possible to see dolphins most often from late May until early August. <b>Praise</b>  They are most common between 10 am and noon, and again between 2 and 4 p.m., when it gets dark.</p><p>You can find them in the water of our beaches including South Walton and Miramar Beaches, Inlet Beach, Inlet Beach, etc. You can see them best between May and August, when the females are closer to shoreline to mate. It is forbidden to touch dolphins, even though they are friendly!</p><p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins require oxygen from the air. However, they can also stay in the water. <b>Paradise</b>  By jumping out of the water, the dolphin is able to stay wet while also taking in oxygen. Dolphins can jump out of water to have fun, improve visibility, eliminate parasites, or to navigate better.</p></div>
