"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Do not touch the dolphins. The dolphins will attempt to make physical contact with you if they feel the need. Touching one dolphin will cause them to leave the area. This not only affects dolphin behavior, but also causes irritation to other members of your group as everyone loses in the swim."
