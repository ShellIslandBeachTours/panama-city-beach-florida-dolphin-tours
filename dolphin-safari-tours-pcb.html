<div> <p>Above, the dolphin became very friendly with a tourist in Varadero in Cuba. This is because dolphins humping humans seems like a popular attraction in Varadero. The video below will make you smile if that wasn't enough. Even the most cynical person will admit that dolphins humping people is hilarious. 16 May 2019</p><p>Panama City Beach is located just east of Destin, on Hwy 98.

<div> <p>Florida law forbids dolphin swimming and feeding. The Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission has officers on the water to enforce these rules. You may have the opportunity to see dolphins from your boat, which will give you a great view and great photos. You can have wild dolphin encounters with dolphins by taking one of our Shell Island Snorkel Tours. <i>Seaside</i>  Dolphins often swim close to snorkelers.</p><p>Swimming with resting spinners dolphins can be considered harassment under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Acts of harassment, torment, and annoyance that have the potential disrupting marine mammal behavior are "harassment" according to the Act.</p><p>Destin. Destin is often known as Florida's beach with the most clear water. Why is this beach special? It's the Choctawhatchee Bay right beyond the beach which acts as a filter taking in the darker sediment, leaving clear waters on top of Destin's fine quartz.</p></div>
